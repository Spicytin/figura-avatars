An M1A2 Abrams main battle tank model originally made by ***BM Heades*** as a [vehicle addon for Minecraft Bedrock](https://mcpedl.com/m1a2-abrams-tank-addon/) and later ported into a Figura avatar by me (***Spikyyn***).

Unlike the original addon, it comes with new animations such as sitting, sleeping, etc. And features like ability to nod or shake the turret using the mod's action wheel. It also comes with new green color variant. Scripts [*Fox's Camera*](https://discord.com/channels/1129805506354085959/1368284918798483496), [*EZAnims*](https://discord.com/channels/1129805506354085959/1143024882041503844), [*Fade avatar*](https://discord.com/channels/1129805506354085959/1143024882041503844), and [*Patpat*](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/1129805506354085959/1130850626218242089) are used for this avatar.

Unfortunately I can't import the custom sounds from the addon as the avatar's file size is close to 100kb to be unuploadable. Also to give it a slight amount of space, I removed few objects in the model and compressed the textures.

Credits to *BM Heades* for the original creator of the tank's model and texture, and ***FOX***, ***JimmyHellp***, ***Squid Eevee***, and ***Auria*** for the author of each of these scripts.
