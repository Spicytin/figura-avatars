An M1A2 Abrams main battle tank model originally made by ***BM Heades*** as a [vehicle addon for Minecraft Bedrock](https://mcpedl.com/m1a2-abrams-tank-addon/) and later ported into a Figura avatar by me (***Spikyyn***).

It comes with new animations such as sitting, sleeping, pulling back a bow, etc. And features like ability to nod or shake the turret using the mod's action wheel. Also, scripts [*Fox's Camera*](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/1129805506354085959/1368284918798483496), [*EZAnims*](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/1129805506354085959/1143024882041503844), and [*Fade avatar*](https://ptb.discord.com/channels/1129805506354085959/1143024882041503844) are used for this avatar.

Credits to ***BM Heades*** for the original creator of the tank's model, and ***FOX***, ***JimmyHellp***, and ***Squid Eevee*** for the author of each of these scripts.
